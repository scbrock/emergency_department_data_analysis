# Emergency Department Data Analysis

# About
This is a data analysis project adapted from a project used for my STA2453 course. This project analyzes simulated emergency department (ED) data (`raw_ed_data.csv`) to draw key insights for emergency department staff.

The entire analysis is self-contained within the file `emergency_department_analysis.ipynb`.

## Getting Started
To run the analysis, download the Jupyter notebook `emergency_department_analysis.ipynb` and data file `raw_ed_data.csv`.

Open the Jupyter notebook and run all cells.
